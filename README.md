# Building a Simple Chatbot from Scratch in Python (using NLTK)

## Motivation
The idea of this project was not to create some prefessional chatbot with exceptional cognitive skills but just to practice my Python skills. This was one of my very first projects, created when I just stepped into the world of NLP and my friend and I thought of creating a simple chatbot that can help with finidng dresses on the amazon just to make use of our newly acquired knowledge.

## Pre-requisites
NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit) and the instruction of how to use this can be found here: https://www.nltk.org/
Installation of NLTK: pip install nltk

## How to run
You can run the program through terminal by typing:
python chatbot.py
